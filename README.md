## Setup in simple terms
- install [obscura](https://github.com/h4ckf0r0day/obscura/releases) (no-render stealth is the one i use)
- install the newest [release](https://github.com/gyatstian/deepseaport/releases) (TIP: CLICK THE BLUE TEXT)
- place obscura and deepseaport next to eachother or put obscura in PATH
- open deepseaport, add account(s) and then start server.
- *optionally play around with settings or/and config.json!*
- base url: http://127.0.0.1:5001/v1

- app needs https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe beacuse of obscura

# deepseaport — DeepSeek web2api (Obscura WAF + real-browser login)

Unofficial, research-only bridge: exposes `chat.deepseek.com` web chat as an
OpenAI-compatible API (`/v1/chat/completions`, streaming + `tools`).

How it works:

- **Obscura** (`h4ckf0r0day/obscura` headless browser) owns a persistent
  profile that solves the AWS WAF JavaScript challenge and holds the
  `aws-waf-token` cookie. All DeepSeek HTTP calls replay that cookie jar,
  with a browser User-Agent captured from the same engine.
- **Auto-token/login** uses a real installed Helium/Chrome/Edge/Chromium via
  CDP (`browser_bin: "auto"`), because DeepSeek's Shumei device-id SDK does
  not initialize in the Obscura no-render engine. Obscura remains the WAF and
  hot-path engine.
- Hot path is direct HTTP (`curl_cffi`, Chrome TLS impersonation):
  login → create session → PoW challenge (`DeepSeekHashV1` wasm) →
  `POST /api/v0/chat/completion` (SSE `p`/`v` events) → delete session.
- No DOM driving per token: fast enough for agentic loops.

Agentic-harness support:

- Full OpenAI `tools` schema in, `tool_calls` out (stream + non-stream),
  parallel calls, stable `call_xxx` ids, `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`.
- `role: tool` results are folded back into the web prompt, so multi-step
  tool loops work against a model with no native function calling.
- One in-flight stream per account (DeepSeek limitation) enforced with
  per-account locks + rotation; auto session cleanup; PoW/WAF retry once.

## Quickstart
**Setup for both:**
Obscura binary (`h4ckf0r0day/obscura`, i personally use no-render stealth): drop
`obscura.exe` next to `config.json` (or under `bin/`, `tools/`,
`vendor/`, `obscura-*/`), or set `obscura_bin` / `OBSCURA_BIN`. path also works.

**A. exe:**
- just run the .exe from the releases

**B. python:**
```powershell
pip install -e .
python -m deepseaport login --email you@x.com  # real Helium/Chrome login, saves token
python -m deepseaport waf                      # verify Obscura + WAF cookie
python -m deepseaport serve                    # :5001
```



```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:5001/v1/models
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:5001/v1/chat/completions `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"stream":true}'
```

## Showcase
**prompt used (inside opencode with a short but sharp agent):** Design and create a very creative, elaborate, and detailed voxel art scene of a pagoda in a beautiful garden with trees, including some cherry blossoms. Make the scene impressive and varied and use colorful voxels. Use whatever libraries to get this done but make sure I can paste it all into a single HTML file and open it in Chrome.<br>

**my opnion:** it looks better than v4 definetly as it has more details but looks much worse than what an actual flash v4.1 can create. it seemed like he just rushed to create it (didn't think about correcting any mistakes after finishing or adding anything further).

## Config

`config.json` (or env, see `.env.example`):

```json
{
  "keys": ["sk-local-dev"],
  "accounts": [{ "email": "you@x.com", "password": "...", "token": "" }],
  "active_account": "",
  "obscura_bin": "",
  "obscura_profile": "",
  "browser_bin": "auto",
  "browser_headless": false,
  "port": 5001,
  "listen": false,
  "chat_model": "deepseek-flash"
}
```

`active_account` is the `CURRENT` selection (`""` = auto-failover over the
whole pool). `chat_model` remembers the last `/model` pick from server-with-chat
mode (env: `DEEPSEAPORT_CHAT_MODEL`). All remaining behaviour flags
(`enable_tools`, `warmup_on_startup`, `auto_delete_session`, `max_retries`,
`parallel_challenge_fetch`, `use_multiple_accounts`, `log_level`,
`stream_mode`) live in `config.example.json` and are editable from the
TUI Settings screen. `enable_append` (default `true`, env:
`DEEPSEAPORT_ENABLE_APPEND`, TUI Settings 15 "Enable append") gates both:
when `false`, stored `append_top` / `append_bottom` texts are kept but
nothing is wrapped into requests. `append_top` / `append_bottom` (env:
`DEEPSEAPORT_APPEND_TOP` / `DEEPSEAPORT_APPEND_BOTTOM`, TUI Settings
16/17 "Append at top/bottom") wrap every outgoing prompt — top text goes at
the absolute top, bottom text at the absolute bottom. Both are multi-line
(`"append_top": "line1\nline2"` in `config.json`); `""` disables.
`send_dry_run_to_frontend` (default `true`, env:
`DEEPSEAPORT_SEND_DRY_RUN_TO_FRONTEND`, TUI Settings 6 "Send dry run to
frontend"): when `true`, the Dry run reply is a normal OpenAI-shaped
response whose content is what dry run prints (raw body + formatted
prompt); when `false`, the content is a short note while the terminal
still prints everything.

`use_multiple_accounts` (default `true`, env:
`DEEPSEAPORT_USE_MULTIPLE_ACCOUNTS`): when `true` and `CURRENT` is busy
(one in-flight stream per account, enforced by per-account lock), cooling
down (banned), or auth-broken (missing/invalid token), the request fails over
to another healthy account — this is what lets parallel subagents /
multitasking share one instance. When `false`, requests stick to `CURRENT`
and queue on it instead.

`"listen": true` serves on `0.0.0.0` (LAN-visible); default `false` binds
`127.0.0.1` only. `--host` flag overrides both.

You can skip email/password by pasting a `userToken` from a logged-in
browser (localStorage) into `accounts[].token`. Raw values and the full
`{"value":"...","__version":"0"}` JSON are both accepted; a `{"value":null}`
shape is normalized to "missing token" instead of causing a later 40003.

When `use_multiple_accounts` is true, an account with a missing/invalid token
is cooled down briefly and the request fails over to the next account that
already has a working token. Use `deepseaport login` (or the TUI auto-token
flow) to provision password-only accounts; the server does not spawn a login
browser on the request hot path.

Bans detected by the server or login page are persisted in `accounts[].banned`
and `accounts[].banned_until`, so the accounts screen keeps showing
`(BANNED: 16 September)` after restarts and even when the account has no token.
Clear that state with `POST /v1/accounts/unblock` or
`python -m deepseaport accounts unblock [identifier]`.

## Endpoints

- `GET /health`, `GET /v1/models`, `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `GET /v1/waf/status` — Obscura binary, profile, WAF cookie state

Models: `deepseek-flash`, `deepseek-flash-reasoner`,
`deepseek-flash-search`, `deepseek-flash-reasoner-search`.
Reasoner models return `reasoning_content` alongside `content`.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for protocol details, auth/PoW/SSE
notes, and the tool-calling design.
